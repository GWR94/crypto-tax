# Crypto Tax & PnL Dashboard

Local, self-hosted crypto portfolio PnL and capital-gains tax dashboard for **UK (HMRC)** and **US (IRS)** taxpayers.

The backend is a deterministic Python/FastAPI tax engine. The frontend is a React (Vite + TypeScript) SPA with Tailwind CSS, shadcn-style components, and Recharts.

> **Disclaimer:** This tool performs deterministic accounting from your ledger for informational purposes. It is **not tax advice**. Verify results with a qualified professional before filing.

## Quick start

```bash
npm run setup   # once — creates .venv, installs Python + Node deps
cp .env.example .env   # optional API keys for wallets / prices
npm run dev     # API :8000 + web UI :5173
```

| Surface | URL |

| Dashboard | http://localhost:5173 |
| API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Health | http://localhost:8000/api/health |

## What it does

- **Dual jurisdiction** — switch UK / US in settings; each uses its own matching engine
- **Portfolio** — holdings, unrealized & realized PnL, allocation charts, tax-loss harvesting hints
- **Tax reports** — UK CGT (with annual exempt amount) + income schedule, or US Form 8949 CSV
- **Imports** — exchange CSVs, wallet address fetch, MEXC email paste, generic CSV/JSON
- **Ledger hygiene** — internal transfer matching, dedup, orphaned-inflow / missing-basis alerts, manual cost-basis overrides
- **Local persistence** — ledger and settings under `data/` (not committed)

Default jurisdiction is **UK**; reporting currency is **GBP** (historical FX applied where needed).

## Tax engines

### UK (HMRC) — `hmrc_cgt_engine.py`

Matching order for each asset (CRYPTO22000-style share matching):

1. **Same-day rule** — disposal matched to acquisitions on the same UK calendar day (Europe/London)
2. **30-day (“bed and breakfast”) rule** — matched to acquisitions in the following 30 days
3. **Section 104 pool** — remaining quantity at average allowable cost

Also:

- UK tax years (`2024/25` = 6 Apr–5 Apr) and published annual exempt amounts
- Airdrops / staking as **miscellaneous income** at FMV, with FMV becoming cost basis
- Native crypto **fees (e.g. gas)** treated as disposals of that asset at FMV
- Liquid-staking unstake yield booked as SOL `STAKING` income; companion SOL `BUY` reduced to principal (no double-count)

### US (IRS) — `tax_engine.py`

- **FIFO**, **LIFO**, or **HIFO** lot matching
- Short-term vs long-term from holding period (**more than** one year → long-term)
- Form 8949-style disposal rows and CSV download
- Same acquisition / disposal / income type model as UK for shared ledger rows

### Shared rules

| Event | Treatment |
| ----- | --------- |
| `BUY` / `AIRDROP` / `STAKING` | Acquisition (cost basis; income types also count as ordinary income at FMV) |
| `SELL` / `FEE` | Disposal (fees on sells reduce proceeds; FEE rows dispose the fee asset at FMV) |
| Paired `TRANSFER` | Non-taxable; basis carries across wallets/exchanges |
| Unpaired `TRANSFER OUT` | Treated as disposal (third-party send / unmatched move) |
| Stablecoins | Treated as cash — excluded from CGT pools |
| Perps | Excluded from spot lot pools; configurable as income / capital gains (folded into CGT / Form 8949 totals) / exclude |

## Supported imports

### Exchange / CSV parsers

| Source | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| Kraken | Ledger CSV + movement normalisations |
| Binance / Crypto.com | Transaction-history layouts |
| Crypto.com app | Dedicated export parser |
| WOO X / Variational | Perp CSVs |
| Solana / EVM / Celestia | Explorer / wallet CSV shapes |
| Generic | Tolerant column aliases (CSV/JSON) |

### Wallet address import

| Chain | Key | Provider |
| ----- | --- | -------- |
| Solana | `HELIUS_API_KEY` (**required**) | [Helius](https://helius.dev) |
| Ethereum + multi-EVM | `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` | [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) (one key covers many chains) |
| Bitcoin | — | Blockstream |
| Cardano | optional `BLOCKFROST_API_KEY` | Koios or Blockfrost |
| Celestia | — | PublicNode |

### Other

- **MEXC** — paste deposit / withdrawal / futures emails
- **CoinGecko** — `COINGECKO_API_KEY` strongly recommended for live + historical USD prices

Copy `.env.example` → `.env` at the repo root, then restart the API. Check `/api/health` for `wallet_import.*` flags.

## Known limitations

These are intentional gaps or work still in progress — do not treat the engine as complete for every DeFi edge case:

- **AMM LP add/remove** — same-signature multi-asset pool deposits book `lp_add` disposals + a synthetic `LP:{trade_group_id}` acquisition at aggregate FMV (`LP_TAX_TREATMENT`). Remove requires an LP burn/out leg (or the synthetic share) to close basis; Helius mint metadata is still incomplete for some pools
- **Lending / vault deposits** (Kamino Lend, Marginfi, Drift, Kvault) are treated as CGT disposals at FMV by default (`LENDING_DEPOSIT_TAX_TREATMENT=cgt_disposal`); set `basis_neutral` to keep TRANSFER legs
- **Hard forks** — configured splits (e.g. ETH→ETHW) synthesize an acquisition at FMV or zero basis (`HARD_FORK_BASIS_POLICY`)
- **US Form 8949** figures are reported in **USD** when jurisdiction is US (UK schedules stay in GBP)
- **US long-term** uses the IRS anniversary rule (day after one-year anniversary), not raw day count
- **UK tax-year bucketing** uses Europe/London calendar dates (same as same-day / 30-day matching)
- **Precision** — UK Section 104 and US FIFO/HIFO lot math use Python `Decimal` internally (API rows stay float, qty 8 dp / fiat 2 dp)
- Perp tax treatment is **configurable policy**, not a fixed legal classification.
  `capital_gains` folds exchange-reported net PnL into CGT / Form 8949 totals as
  synthetic rows; fills never enter spot FIFO / Section 104 pools.

The HMRC compliance matrix (`apps/api/app/hmrc_matrix.py` + `npm run test:hmrc-matrix`) documents pass / known-gap cases.

### Official HMRC worked examples

Pooling goldens from the Cryptoassets Manual
([CRYPTO22250](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual/crypto22250))
live in `apps/api/app/hmrc_official_examples.py` and
`tests/test_hmrc_official_examples.py`:

| Ref | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| CRYPTO22251–22257 | Section 104, same-day, 30-day, crypto-to-crypto (assert exact engine totals; HMRC mid-calc rounding noted) |

**Gaps with no official numerical tables** (staking, airdrops, fees, forks) are covered as
`narrative_instantiated` / `engine_policy` fixtures citing CRYPTO21200, CRYPTO21250,
CRYPTO22300, CRYPTO22350 — invented GBP amounts, clear provenance labels.
